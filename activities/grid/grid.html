            <h2>Engagement Questions:</h2>
            <p>1. What should you focus on during class and after class?</p>
            <blockquote>
                During class, we are ask to just focus on grid and follow what is being coded by the instructor. We are also ask to play around how grid works. After class, we are ask to continue solving the grid garden and making sure that we understand everything that was being instructed there.
            </blockquote>
            <p>2. What is the main difference between CSS grid and CSS flex?</p>
            <blockquote>
                The CSS grid is used in two-dimensional layout for both rows and columns while the CSS flexbox is used for one-dimensional layotus, with either row or column.
