        <h2>Engagement Questions:</h2>
        <p>1. What have you learned about Flex and CSS?</p>
        <blockquote>
            I have learned that using flex can help you to not worry about adjusting the size of a block in the HTML since flex will make that block flexible, depending on what size of the screen the HTML page is being viewed from, or what type of device it is being viewed from.
        </blockquote>
        <p>2. Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</p>
        <blockquote>
            When we have an accessible website, the design and developing it is in a way that will allow people of all abilities, including those that are with disabilities to view the page and navigate it effectively. It is essential as to have inclusivity to all possible users and because it is with the law.
