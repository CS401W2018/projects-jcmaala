        <h2>Engagement Questions:</h2>
        <p>1. What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on Youtube?</p>
        <blockquote>
            With hosting your videos on Youtube, you will be able to have your videos on your page without thinking so much of the file size since you only need the embedded link from Youtube. The disadvantage of this is that not all Youtube videos that you want to use into your website have a visible thumbnail, which might affect the design and accessibility of the video.
        </blockquote>
        <p>2. What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</p>
        <blockquote>
            In HTML & CSS, the most useful thing you can do with a transform is manipulating elements visually without affecting the document layout.
        </blockquote>
        <p>3. How do you stay safe online?</p>
        <blockquote>
            By having your website use the HTTPS protocol where it will assign or give you a public and private key use for encryption and decryption of data so that network intruders cannot access anything in your network.
        </blockquote>
        <p>4. What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</p>
        <blockquote>
            This Friday will have a continued discussion on the remaining lessons for the semester. Next week are mock tests, and then the week after that is the actual test and the website presentation.
