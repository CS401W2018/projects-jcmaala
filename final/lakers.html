            <p>After his comeback in Cleveland and making the team a world champion in the span of two years since his comeback, LeBron James decided to move his talent in Los Angeles Lakers, a team that is very known for the numbers of championships it has. Los Angeles Lakers was a struggling team before LeBron came with no starters and pretty much on their team rebuilding state. On one occassion, LeBron James mentioned that it was one of his dream to be playing with the team, and so some fans were not that shocked when the news came that he is moving to the Lakers. He was able to help rebuild the team into a competitive one by acquiring key players like Lance Stephenson, JR Smith, Rajon Rondo, and others.</p>
            <p>In 2020 as his second season with the Lakers, they were able to acquire Anthony Davis. He quickly became one of the team's key player that led them to a challenging NBA Finals in 2020 because of covid-19 and the pandemic. They played the rest of the season in the bubble including the Finals where they faced against Jimmy Buttler and the Miami Heat, which is his former team. They won 4-2 against them.</p>
            <p>LeBron is still playing with the Lakers currently, with Davis being traded to Dallas Mavericks with Luka Doncic, a superstar hailed for his basketball IQ. The trade was even named by some experts as "the trade of the century" because of how huge it was, both for the fans and for the organization.</p>
            <p>Bellow is a video of LeBron James' highlights since he played for the Lakers.</p>
