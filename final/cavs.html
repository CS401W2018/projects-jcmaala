            <p>When LeBron got drafted in the NBA in 2003, fans and critics were both excited to see what he can offer to the league, especially in the team that no one heard of because of the struggle it has in making in to NBA playoffs. He was seen as the hope for the team to make a change, and that was exactly he did during his rookie season. Although the team didn't make it to the playoffs again, he showed phenomenal performance as he finished the season with 20.9 points per game, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game, making him the rookie of the year on that season.</p>
            <p>This was also the team that defined LeBron's career from a fan's perspective. In this team he was able to achieve many things in his career, like being part of the NBA all-star selection for the first time as that same season was also the season where he rose to superstardom. People now are talking about him and he became one of the most famous basketball player in the planet. In the year 2007, he got his first NBA final appearance against Tim Duncan and the Spurs. They had the great run on that season and everyone thought that they are a good match for San Antonio Spurs. But fans were disappointed when the Cavaliers got sweeped by the Spurs with 4-0 finals standing. Despite the loss, LeBron had a great playoff careeer stats that year, considering he was only 22 to carry his team to the NBA Finals.</p>
            <p>After a controversial decision he made in 2010 where he went to play for Miami Heat and won his first up to third championship in his career, James decided to go back to Cleveland and try to take a shot for a title for his hometown. In his first season coming back as a Cavalier, he was able to carry the team to their first final appearance in more than 10 years where they face the Golden State Warriors. The team was composed of rising stars at the time like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. There team have been a great playoff contender for the past seasons and it was also a great test for them to play against LeBron and the Cavaliers. Their first NBA Finals matchup end up having Warriors as the champion with 4-2 standing. The next season was also the same, with both of the teams fighting for championship. This championship series was such a historic one as LeBron and the Cavaliers made the 3-1 deficit and became the NBA Champions. Their Finals rivalry went on for the next 2 years, the Warriors being able to acquire Kevin Durant the season after the Cavaliers beat them.</p>
            <p>The next two years of their NBA Finals matchup, LeBron and the Cavaliers never won again a title, especially that they lose one of their star players as well which is Kyrie Irving. The Cavaliers tried to rebuild the team again around LeBron by acquiring key players like Dwane Wade and Derrick Rose but the team chemistry just wasn't there.</p>
