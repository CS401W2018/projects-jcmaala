            <h1>LeBron James's Career Stats</h1>
            <p>LeBron has a very phenomenal career, with which a lot of it comes from playing for 21 season. He was able to beat what others think is an unbeatable record which is the highest number of career points in the history of the NBA. It was led by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, with which he recorded an enormous 38,387 until this record was broken by LeBron James in February 7, 2023. As of the moment, LeBron's career scoring record is 42,069, making it even harder to break for someone who tries to dare it.</p>
            <p>Below is a table that shows LeBron James's stats over his career. It includes points-per-game, assists, rebounds, blocks, steals, and other important information base on the team he played with:</p>
