            <p>The year 2010 might be one of the toughest year for LeBron James, not just on his career but also in his life. Both him and his fans knew how special it is for him to be drafted in his own hometown and how Cleveland has high expectation for him to get them the championship for the first time since the Cleveland Cavaliers was created. In the off season of 2010, all people, fans and critics alike were shocked when he set an interview with the ESPN about his decision to move his talent in the south beach, particularly in Miami Heat. In the interview, James mentioned that this move will help make his career better and that it allows him to learn and enhance his basketball talent.</p>
            <p>As expected, fans were not happy with his decision in moving into south beach. Fans from Cleveland can be seen burning his jersey on TV saying that he gave up on his promise in giving them championships. Some called him selfish, and that all he think about is getting money and chasing a ring for himself. Sports critics have been talking about the decision for months, trying to deep dive his thought process in his decision about playing for Miami Heat.</p>
            <p>When he got traded to Miami, it was just not him who joined the already famous and basketball superstar Dwane Wade. An all-star player for Toronto Raptors named Chris Bosh. He played for the Raptors for seven season prior to his trade in Miami where he averaged 20.2 points per game, 9.4 rebounds per game, an assists of 2.2 and blocks that averaged 1.2 per game. He was a solid addition to the team with LeBron as they goal of getting many championship titles with the team's new trio.</p>
            <p>And in deed, they did just that. On the first year of them playing together, they went to the NBA Finals facing the Dallas Mavericks. A lot of basketball analysts thought that they will going to win it all, but they failed as the Mavericks beat them in 4-2 standing. The year after, they went to the NBA Finals again but they faced the young Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder. They beat the team in 4-1 standing, and James got his first NBA title after playing for 9 seasons. They again won an NBA title against the San Antonio Spurs. The next season, they played against the San Antonio Spurs again where they lost 4-1.</p>
