    <h1>Hello! My name is Jean Clyde Maala</h1>
    <p>
        And I prefer people calling me by my name initial, <u>JC</u>. I am from the Philippines. I was born and raise in the island of Mindanao, which is the southern part of the Philippines.
        Growing up, I really like playing <i>basketball</i>. I used to play basketball with my siblings and with my dad. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing that I like people to know about me is that I like to be engaged in an <mark>interesting conversation</mark> with people.
        I also like eating foods! Here are the list of foods that I love:
        <ol type="A"><strong>
            <li>Filipino Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Sinigang</li>
            <li>Adobo</li>
            <li>Lumpia Shanghai</li>
        </ol></strong>
    </p>
