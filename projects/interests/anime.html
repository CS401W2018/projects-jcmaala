        <h2>Boku No Hero Academia</h2>
        <p>This anime is one of the anime that I'm interested because this talks about being okay with not being special. While everyone has their own quirks or powers, the protagonist doesn't have one but he still manage to be able to act as a hero and help other people.</p>
        <h2>Jujutsu Kaisen</h2>
        <p>I like this anime because the story is just so interesting. Like Hero academia, the protagonist also starts as someone who doesn't know about harnessing his power, basically a powerless guy. But through training and studying with curse energy, he was able to develop his skills and power that allows him to fight their enemies and save people.</p>
        <h2>About Links</h2>
        <p>There are two links that is used in HTML, namely the Relative link and an Absolute Link. A relative link gives you directions to a page that exists locally. While the absolute link gives you the full address of a website that exists in the internet.</p>
