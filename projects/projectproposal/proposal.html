        <h2>Final Project Plan:</h2>
        <p>1. The title and topic of your site.</p>
        <blockquote>
            The title for my project website is Lebron James and his career legacy, and it will focus on his achievements as a basketball player and his success outside of basketball like philanthropy. 
        </blockquote>
        <p>2. A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</p>
        <blockquote>
            I choose this topic because LeBron James has been one of the famous person that I admire, especially because I also love basketball so much. I am always amazed at how he is still able to play basketball in the same level as others given his age now. This topic also fits perfectly to other requirements of the website and I feel like having this topic makes it easier for me to create a project website.
        </blockquote>
        <p>3. List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</p>
        <blockquote>For the home page, I plan on putting the following information:
            <ul>
                <li>A brief overview of the life of LeBron James.</li>
                <li>His journey in early life basketball.</li>
                <li>His NBA career.</li>
            </ul>
            The second page will talk about his career specifically in Cleveland Cavaliers where he first played. It will talk about his struggles and his journey towards his first playoff appearance. The third page will talk about his career in Miami Heat, his second team where he won his first, second and third championship. And then the fourth page will talk about his return in Cleveland Cavaliers where he won his fourth title. The fifth page will talk about his career in Los Angeles Lakers where he won his fifth title in a historic NBA bubble during pandemic. Another page will show his career stats in each of the teams he played.

        <p>4. What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</p>
        <blockquote>
            I will put information like name, email, age, favorite team, and then a checkbox that will say that they want to be notified about the latest updates in LeBron's career in the form field. On the table, I will put game stats of lebron on the teams he played with.
        </blockquote>
        <p>5. How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</p>
        <blockquote>
            I will gather data through the NBA website, ESPN, and also Wikipedia and other trusted sources, without copy and pasting their contents.
        </blockquote>
        <p>6. Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</p>
        <blockquote>
